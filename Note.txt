In each round, if the snake will automatically increase or decrease it length depends on the whether it had a food or not, then:

1) Create a variable to store the length of the snake. Every time eat a food, then increase one, otherwise, after each round do an update to decrease one. 
Questions here: Not sure if we could get the initial value of the snake length from the server, or the server will actually tell us the length of our snake.
